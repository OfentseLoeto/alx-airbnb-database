- This document describes the sample data provided in the seed_data.sql file, which is designed to populate a MySQL database with a basic set of records for an AirBnB booking application.
- The data is structured to demonstrate the relationships between the tables and to provide a foundation for testing and development.

How to Use:

- To use this data, simply execute the seed.sql script on your MySQL database.
Ensure that the database schema (the tables with their columns and constraints) has already been successfully created.
- The script will handle the UUID generation for you and insert the data in the correct order to satisfy all foreign key dependencies.
